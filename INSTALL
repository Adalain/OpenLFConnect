2. Installation
Download:

Archive

Git repo:
	git clone git@github.com:jrspruitt/OpenLFConnect.git

Operating System:
General
The program makes every attempt to figure out what it needs to know on its own. If you run into problems there are helper functions that should be able to let you manually configure around it.

Windows - General
	Disable Monitor.exe in the Task Manager first. This will prevent LFConnect from opening when one of your devices is pluged in. Warning it will be started on next reboot, or if LFConnect is opened. To permenantly disable it, look for this registry key and delete, this example is from XP Pro.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Monitor

Windows - Explorer or LeapPad
	Turn your device on and plug in the USB cable. You should see a network icon, attempting to connect, or look in your network devices	for the new connection. You want to open up the properties, got to TCP/IP go to properties, and change the settings from obtain IP from DHCP and instead use a static IP address.

Static IP 169.254.0.1
Netmask   255.255.0.0

You can use any IP you want that starts with 169.254 This is the zeroconfig subnet the devices will be on. The only time the host IP address will be needed, is when connecting to the device, a route will need to be set. If you choose something different than the example change the default in OpenLFConnect.py in the applications root directory.

self._host_ip_default = '169.254.0.1'


Windows - Didj
	Plug your device in, and go to manage your computer. You want to find the disks section, there you will find a roughly 250mb FAT disk. You'll need to assign it a drive letter, as LFConnect mounts it in a different way. The drive letter does not matter, just one that is not conflicting with other devices. OpenLFConnect will go through the disks and find the right one.


Linux - General
	Make sure you have sg3_utils installed, as this program relies on them being available. There are some inherent permission issues with the device files that will need to be dealt with. The easiest way is to use a udev rule, which will give a common user access to the device, and set up a presistent device name. In OpenLFConnect/src/udev you will find the rules. There is one for USB Storage device and one for Ethernet. It is highly

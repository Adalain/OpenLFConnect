OpenLFConnect is a Python and sg3_utils based replacement application for the LeapFrog LFConnect program. For Explorer and LeapPad it can use their dftpdevice to upload firmware. It also manages uploading the surgeon.cbf file for USB boot recovery mode and is capable of enabling sshd on both devices. For Didj it can mount the USB drive, copy firmware over, and send the eject command that will attempt to start flashing the firmware.

WARNING: This program attempts to flash new firmware, has the ability to make and delete, upload and download, files could be destroyed, firmware flashing could go wrong. There is no prompts for second chances.

Check OpenLFConnect/INSTALL for installation and configuration.
